# Gayle's tips

1. Make sure you identify the terms when evaluating big O, not just using a generic n term.
2. only keep the non-constant dominant terms (as long as they are for the same quantity)

```
O(d + n^2) -> O(d + n^2)
O(2^a + a^2) --> O(2^a)
```

## Seven steps to problem solving

### 1. Listen carefully to the problem - listen to clues. 

For example,

> Given two arrays that are sorted and distinct, find the number of elements in common

So the fact that they are "sorted" and "distinct" are useful clues. If your solution does not exploit this feature then
it's likely not optimal for this usecase. The brute-force approach will probably not use this information, but keep it visible and
consider it for the optimal approach which you will code.

### 2. Draw an example

Use inputs and outputs to further understand the behavior. 

Here is one possibility

```
[1,3,5,7]
[2,3,4,6]
```

But the problem is that this is a special case and you need to think of more general cases. The arrays may be different lengths
or not have any common elements, have negtive numbers etc.

### 3. Brute force

It will be slow and obvious and that is fine. But it will help you think about a starting point. Don't code this one unless asked,
but use it to explore the next step of making it optimal byt identifying the time and space complexities so you know where
you need to focus to devise a solution you can code. The brute force method may not be correct, but figure out how to correct it
after you have something.

### 4. Optimize

A good chunk of time will be spent on this step. **Optimize before you write code**. But, if the interviewer wants you to code the brute-force first then go ahead and do that before this step. Make sure you state the time and space complexities clearly.

### 5. Walk through your algorithm

Before you start coding, walk through the algorithm with your interviewer. **Don't jump into coding with just a basic idea**!!!ðŸ˜¥
Even if you're interviewer agrees you can start coding, think! Do you have a good idea of the algorithm?
If not then walk through it more carefully before committing. Because backing out half-way may not be the best look.

Make sure you know what the data structures are, how they change. If there are indices involved then make sure you know how they
are updated using examples.

### 6. Code

Use the language you're most comfortable with.

> data structures and gotchas. While perfect syntax is not a hard requirement, fumbling around
> with syntax can be a huge distraction and may end being a negative

### 7. Verification

Check the runtimes and make sure they agree with your earlier assessment. Walk through the code with examples you came up with.
Even if you have the option of testing the code, walk through them manually first. This step will help to catch any bugs you
may have in the code.

### Finally

Once this is done, walk through the code again and explain it. Consider it a code review session where you want to make sure the
reviewer is satisfied and will be ready to approve your code. Answer any questions they have.
This shows attention to details and that you care about code quality.


## Example

For the given problem, let's see the bruteforce approach

```
a1 = [1,3,6,10,18]
a2 = [4,6]
res = [6]


a1 = [-10, -8, 0, 3, 5]
a2 = [0, 3, 5]
res = [0,3,5]

output is an array


```
nested for loop
iterate each element
i 0
j 0 1 2 ...
i 1
j 0 1 2....

brute force would be time: O(n1*n2) where array 1 is n1 and array 2 is n2
space: O(1) since no recursion or extra mem allocations

We know the arrays are sorted and has no dups

Ok so if we used a hash set to store the elements of one array we can do O(1) lookups for that array.
But that incurs the penalty of extra memory.

Since the array is sorted, they probably want to you to try a binary search to cut the look up time down from linear to
logarithmic.




## Optimizing with BUD

BUD = Bottlenecks, Unnecessary work, Duplicated work


## Optimizing with space and time

* hash tables, pre-computation, tries
* think about doing some upfront work such as sorting, storing data in table etc.

## best conceivable runtime

Given the nature of the problem, what is the runtime that you cannot beat

Example

> given an array, find all pairs that sum to median value

You cannot do better than O(n) where n is size of array since you must access every element at least once

## Tips for coding

* Don't write loose code, write small functions
* When filling in the func impls, try a priority-based breadth first approach, work on the most useful functions first and then fill in the rest ( you need to maximize your signals to the interviewer)
