# Gayle's tips

1. Make sure you identify the terms when evaluating big O, not just using a generic n term.
2. only keep the non-constant dominant terms (as long as they are for the same quantity)

```
O(d + n^2) -> O(d + n^2)
O(2^a + a^2) --> O(2^a)
```

## Seven steps to problem solving

### 1. Listen carefully to the problem - listen to clues. 

For example,

> Given two arrays that are sorted and distinct, find the number of elements in common

So the fact that they are "sorted" and "distinct" are useful clues. If your solution does not exploit this feature then
it's likely not optimal for this usecase. The brute-force approach will probably not use this information, but keep it visible and
consider it for the optimal approach which you will code.

### 2. Draw an example

Use inputs and outputs to further understand the behavior. 

Here is one possibility

```
[1,3,5,7]
[2,3,4,6]
```

But the problem is that this is a special case and you need to think of more general cases. The arrays may be different lengths
or not have any common elements, have negtive numbers etc.

### 3. Brute force

It will be slow and obvious and that is fine. But it will help you think about a starting point. Don't code this one unless asked,
but use it to explore the next step of making it optimal byt identifying the time and space complexities so you know where
you need to focus to devise a solution you can code. The brute force method may not be correct, but figure out how to correct it
after you have something.

### 4. Optimize

A good chunk of time will be spent on this step. **Optimize before you write code**. But, if the interviewer wants you to code the brute-force first then go ahead and do that before this step. Make sure you state the time and space complexities clearly.

### 5. Walk through your algorithm

Before you start coding, walk through the algorithm with your interviewer. **Don't jump into coding with just a basic idea**!!!ðŸ˜¥
Even if you're interviewer agrees you can start coding, think! Do you have a good idea of the algorithm?
If not then walk through it more carefully before committing. Because backing out half-way may not be the best look.

Make sure you know what the data structures are, how they change. If there are indices involved then make sure you know how they
are updated using examples.

### 6. Code

Use the language you're most comfortable with.

> with syntax can be a huge distraction and may end being a negative

### 7. Verification

Check the runtimes and make sure they agree with your earlier assessment. Walk through the code with examples you came up with.
Even if you have the option of testing the code, walk through them manually first. This step will help to catch any bugs you
may have in the code.

### Finally

Once this is done, walk through the code again and explain it. Consider it a code review session where you want to make sure the
reviewer is satisfied and will be ready to approve your code. Answer any questions they have.
