# Gayle's tips

1. Make sure you identify the terms when evaluating big O, not just using a generic n term.
2. only keep the non-constant dominant terms (as long as they are for the same quantity)

```
O(d + n^2) -> O(d + n^2)
O(2^a + a^2) --> O(2^a)
```

## Seven steps to problem solving

### 1. Listen carefully to the problem - listen to clues. 

For example,

> Given two arrays that are sorted and distinct, find the number of elements in common

So the fact that they are "sorted" and "distinct" are useful clues. If your solution does not exploit this feature then
it's likely not optimal for this usecase. The brute-force approach will probably not use this information, but keep it visible and
consider it for the optimal approach which you will code.

### 2. Draw an example

Use inputs and outputs to further understand the behavior. 

Here is one possibility

```
[1,3,5,7]
[2,3,4,6]
```

But the problem is that this is a special case and you need to think of more general cases. The arrays may be different lengths
or not have any common elements, have negtive numbers etc.
